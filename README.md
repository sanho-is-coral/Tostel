The goal of the game is to move the character to the top using arrow buttons.
A left or right drawer of the next level randomly opens when the character reaches a certain level.
The door opens with a playing sound irregularly controlled by random factors.
If the character is moving when the door is opened, the game plays game over scene.

# Animator

Once external scripts affect the animation bool variable, that changes the animation status.
Four animation controllers in total.
